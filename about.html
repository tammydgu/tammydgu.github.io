      <p style="font-family:NexaLight;">Mac Ayres, born December 6th, 1996 in Sea Cliff, NY, is a 22 year old singer and songwriter that specializes in creating soulful R&B music. He signed with the record label ARIMÉ and is a self-taught producer, singer, and multi-instrumentalist with his interest in music stemming from a very early age. For instance, Ayres received his first keyboard as a gift when he was 11 and was fascinated by it - running home every day after school just to sit and play it. He believes, "There's something you can learn from an instrument every day, and that was just something I always enjoyed about it." This same mentality led to him learning both the guitar as well as the bass. </p>
      <p style="font-family:NexaLight;">Mac Ayres cites his musical inspirations as Stevie Wonder, D'Angelo, J Dilla, Michael Jackson, and Marvin Gaye but nonetheless has developed his own,distinguished R&B style. Ayres released his debut album, "Drive Slow" in 2017. The creation of this album, from beginning to end, to Ayres around 9 months. Ayres has said that the most meaningful song to him on "Drive Slow" is the song, "Calvin's Joint". Not only is this song the first full length song on the album, it is also written about leaving home (Sea Cliff, NY) for the first time. He then released his second album, "Something to Feel" in 2018. Ayres claims that he doesn't work well with a deadline but attempts to maintain a creative mindset at all times. On days where inspiration flows, songs can even begin to emerge in a single evening. Mac Ayres is currently on a tour in Asia, having played his most recent show on March 13th in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
